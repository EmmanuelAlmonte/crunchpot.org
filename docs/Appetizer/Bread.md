#### Ingredients:

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/4 cups warm water
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

#### Instructions

- In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt
- Add the warm water and olive oil to the bowl and stir everything together until a sticky dough forms.
- Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.-
- Form the dough into a ball and place it into a greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest in a warm, draft-free place for 1-2 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.
- Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
- Remove the dough from the bowl and punch it down to remove any air pockets.
- Use a sharp knife to make a few shallow slashes across the top of the bread.
- Bake the bread in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
- Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
- There's nothing quite like the aroma and taste of fresh, homemade bread. With our simple recipe, you can easily achieve bakery-worthy results from the comfort of your own kitchen.
