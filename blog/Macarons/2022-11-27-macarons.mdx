Instructions
Macaron Shells
Make a recipe for Swiss Macarons and color it orange by using just one or two drops of orange food coloring,

Then line the piping bag youâ€™ll use to pipe the macaron batter with the piping tip of choice (I like to use a Wilton 12 to pipe my shells).
Place the piping bag inside of a cup, with the sides of the bag folded outwards so the bag will stay open.
Place a drop of orange food coloring on a small bowl or plate.
Dip a brush in the food coloring, and then brush the sides of the piping bag with the food coloring.
Then place the orange batter inside.
Pipe the shells as indicated in the recipe, do make sure to let them rest until completely dry before baking.
Let the shells cool down before filling.
